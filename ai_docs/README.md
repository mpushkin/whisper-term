Whisper Term Documentation
==========================

Purpose
-------
This folder contains documentation for the Whisper Term project - a terminal app for whisper speech to text model.

Quick Start
-----------
1. Use the `current/` folder for documenting the current state of the system.
2. Use the `vision/` folder for documenting future plans and direction.
3. Use the `ideas/` folder for brainstorming and unvetted improvement proposals.
4. Use the `iterations/` folder for planned improvement efforts.
5. Use templates from `templates/` folder to maintain consistency.

Folder Structure
----------------
current/      – Snapshot of how the system works today (overview, architecture, usage, etc.)  
vision/       – High-level direction of where the project is going.  
ideas/        – Unvetted improvement proposals; a scratchpad for brainstorming.  
iterations/   – Groomed, trackable improvement efforts (design → plan → reflection).  
templates/    – Reusable skeleton files for new ideas and iterations.

Guiding Principles
------------------
• Keep documentation concise and actionable.  
• Separate present-state docs (current) from future-state docs (vision).  
• Capture raw thoughts in ideas; refine and execute them in iterations.  
• Review and update docs continuously—outdated docs are worse than none.  

Enjoy writing!
