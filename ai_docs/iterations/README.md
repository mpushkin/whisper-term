# Iterations Space

Each sub-folder represents a groomed, time-boxed improvement effort.

Folder naming: `NNNN-short-title`, where **NNNN** is an incremental number starting at `0000`.

Every iteration **always** contains four Markdown files that tell a complete story:

| Doc              | Purpose                                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `investigation.md`      | Analyse the current state, problems, and research. |
| `design.md`             | Describe the chosen solution at a high level.      |
| `technical_change_plan.md`| Technical implementation details & code changes.   |
| `reflection.md`         | Capture outcomes & lessons learned.               |

> Copy the folder `0000-template/` to start a new iteration and fill in each file.
